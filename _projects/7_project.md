# Fixed-wing RC Plane Design and Implementation

This project involved designing and building a remote-controlled fixed-wing aircraft from scratch. The plane features a single propeller configuration and was designed for stable flight characteristics while maintaining good maneuverability. This was a two-person project and was my first time designing and building an RC plane from scratch.

## Design Specifications

- **Wing Span:** 724 mm (600 mm + 62mm wing tip Ã— 2)
- **Airfoil:** NACA 4415
  - Chord Length: 90 mm
- **Propulsion System:**
  - Motor: 2200 KV Brushless Motor
  - Battery: 4500 mAh 2C LiPo
  - Propeller: 6045 Three-blade

## Flight Testing

The aircraft underwent extensive flight testing to verify its performance and handling characteristics. Below is a video of one of the successful test flights:

    </div>

Althought it crash right after the first flight, this was the first time I built an RC plane from scratch and I learned a lot from this experience.
