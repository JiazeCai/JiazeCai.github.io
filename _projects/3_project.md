## Project Overview

From May 2021 to May 2022, I participated in the SAE AERO Design Competition as part of the Texas A&M University team. Our challenge was to design, manufacture, and test a wooden aircraft capable of carrying 27 soccer balls during flight missions. We won the 1st place in the Regular Class world-wide! It has been more than 5 years our team secures the 1st place in the world-wide SAE AERO Design Competition for regular class.

### Key Contributions:
- Implemented Pixhawk flight controller integration for data acquisition during flight tests
- Conducted flight test data analysis for design optimization
- Designed winglets and fairings using CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) analysis
- Developed and tested subscale wind-tunnel models for aerodynamic validation

## Technical Highlights

The aircraft was designed with several innovative features:
- Wooden construction optimized for strength and weight
- Truss stucture wing ribs
- Cargo bay capable of storing 27 soccer balls inside the wing
- Custom-designed winglets for improved aerodynamic efficiency (Shape like a Orca whale)
- Comprehensive CFD analysis and wind tunnel testing
