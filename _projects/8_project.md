## Other Projects

This section is for the projects that I did before 2019. Some of them are not really a project but just some fun things I did.

### VTOL UAV Design
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/project_other/VTOL.jpg" title="VTOL UAV Design" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1"  width="50%"%}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    This is a design of a bi-copter tilt-rotor VTOL UAV. It also has a closed wing design.

I loved to build and play with model planes, cars, and boats when I was a kid. I always keep them carefully until now.

    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    This is a RC sailboat I built since primary school. It is a unpowered boat with only the control of a rudder and the the max angle of the sail. I used to sail the boat utilizing the wind in a lake near my house.
