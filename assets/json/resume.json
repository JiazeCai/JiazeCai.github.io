      "summary": "Bird-sized flapping-wing robots offer significant potential for agile flight in complex environments, but achieving agile and robust trajectory tracking remains a challenge due to the complex aerodynamics and highly nonlinear dynamics inherent in flapping-wing flight. In this work, a learning-based control approach is introduced to unlock the versatility and adaptiveness of flapping-wing flight."

Over history, people have implemented the PID controller mechanically with pneumatical components, electronically in circuits, or digitally using DSP. However, the pure mechanical realization of PID controllers is rarely studied."
