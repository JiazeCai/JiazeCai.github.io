Hi! I am a PhD student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at MIT, working in the [Soft and Micro Robotics Laboratory](https://smrl.mit.edu/) advised by Prof. [Kevin Chen](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/people/yufeng-kevin-chen/). My research interest is in the design and low-level control of bio-inspired aerial robots, particularly bird-scale and micro flapping-wing platforms.

I received my B.S. in Aerospace Engineering with a minor in Electrical Engineering from Texas A&M University and my M.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering (with a concentration in Control of Robotic and Autonomous Systems) from the University of California, Berkeley. During my master's, I was a Research Assistant at [UC Berkeley Hybrid Robotics Group](https://hybrid-robotics.berkeley.edu/) advised by Prof. [Koushil Sreenath](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/koushil-sreenath/), working on the design and learning-based control for a bird-inspired flapping-wing UAV.

Since high school, I have designed and built FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) robots and made DIY drones with Arduino. In college, I was a [TAMU SAE AERO](https://www.tamusaeaero.org/) Aerodynamic, Stability & Control (ASC) Sub-team member working on the aerodynamic design of a 16-lb wooden Aircraft that can store 26 soccer balls inside its wing. I was also an undergraduate researcher at [TAMU Advanced Vertical Flight Lab](https://avfl.engr.tamu.edu/) supervised by Prof. [Moble Benedict](https://engineering.tamu.edu/aerospace/profiles/mbenedict.html), where I worked on Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL) Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and flight dynamics.

You can find more details about my work in the [publications page](/publications/) and view my [full portfolio](/projects/) for more projects and research work.
